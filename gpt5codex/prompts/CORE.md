Math World Theater is a system to explore mathematical charts and systems in unique ways:

- Mandelbrot Sets and derivatives such as Julia Sets and the original bifurcation diagram.
- Lindenmeyer systems and derivatives for 3d
- Cellular automata, beginning with the John Conway's Game of Life.
- Voronoi diagrams and derivatives.
- Other diagrams to follow.

Unique is the ability to mix the diagrams in different ways:

1. Using Voronoi or Delauney Triangulation to overlay the game of life
1. Ability to support loading of different models
1. Ability to support changing the color palette, with animation
1. Support different geometries
  1. Support a fixed euclidian plian, with or without wraparound.
  1. Support an infinite plain
  1. Support rendering onto a sphere.

Every combination and rendering option will be provided.
