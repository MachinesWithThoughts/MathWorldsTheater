Math World Theater

# Vision
Math Worlds Theater is an interactive playground for exploring the beauty and complexity of mathematical structures. The app will provide a curated menu of algorithms — from cellular automata to fractals to Voronoi diagrams — each rendered in dynamic, visually engaging ways. Users will be able to adjust parameters in real time, experiment with multiple rendering styles, and discover emergent patterns.

Beyond flat Euclidean space, the app will also support alternative geometries, such as spherical mappings, offering fresh perspectives on familiar algorithms. Whether for education, research, or creative exploration, Math Worlds T aims to be both a laboratory and a gallery — a place where mathematics becomes an immersive, interactive experience.
